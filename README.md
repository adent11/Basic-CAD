## Base

### Description

In this assignment I created the base to the caster. It is a rectangular prism that is 200 mm x 120 mm x 8 mm with 6 10 mm holes equally spaced 20 mm from the edge.

### Reflection

This assignment wasn't particularly challenging as the basics of Onshape aren't very different than Solidworks. One useful thing that I learned was some of the shortcuts:
* Shift + S to sketch
* C for circle
* Shift E to extrude

## Mount

### Description

In this assignment I created the mount part of the caster. It is a 120 mm square extruded 8 mm with a 25 mm hole in the center and four 10 mm holes whose centers are 20 mm away from the edge. 

### Evidence

### Reflection

This assignment also wasn't a challenge, but one thing I learned in the tutorial video was how make multiple parts in the same part studio by selecting "New" instead of "Add" when you extrude.

## Fork

### Description

In this assignment I designed the fork that attaches the axle to the base of the caster. It has a circular base with two prongs, with holes for the axle, and a cylinder on the top that attaches to the base.

### Evidence

### Image

### Reflection

One thing that I learned is that you can select tangent propogation when doing a fillet to automatically select all edges tangent to the one you select; also the shortcut for a fillet is Shift + F.

---


## Tire

### Description

In this assignment I designed the tire of the caster. It is a trapezoid revolved around the origin to make the wheel, with fillets on both sides to round the edges.

### Evidence

### Image

### Reflection

Something useful that I learned is that if you place a dimension between a centerline and another line past the centerline, it doubles, making it convenient for making diameter.

---


## Wheel

### Description

In this assignment I designed the wheel of the caster. It is revolved I shape with holes cut to make spokes, then some fillets.

### Evidence

### Image

### Reflection

One thing that I learned in this assignment is that when you are doing a fillet or chamfer you can click a face and all of its edges will be automatically selected.

## Axle, Collar, Bearings

### Description

In this assignment I made the axle, which is a cylinder with flat cuts on the ends for set screws, a collar that attaches to the end of the axle, and two different sized bearings.

### Evidence

### Reflection

This assignment showed me how easiy it is to use part studios to make multiple parts without even having to make any new sketches.

## Sub-Assembly

### Description

In this assingment I assembled the wheel and tire, then added the axle and bearings on both sides.

### Evidence

[Sub-Assembly in Onshape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/f7ea84346f453cdc483ecf33/w/3f3de681c1975644dbaf9af1/e/30f5d041ffcd135b3e4c331d)

### Image

<img src="Images/Sub-Assembly.png" alt="" height="150">

### Reflection

In this assignment I learned how fastened and revolute mates work; fastened mates constrain all planar and rotational movement, and revolute mates constrain all planar and all but one axis of rotational movement. Also I learned that if you click the play button on a mate it will show in what ways it can move.

---

## Final Caster Assembly

### Description

In this assignment I took the assembled the base, mount, and fork of the caster, then added the sub-assembly from the last assignment. After that I added nuts and bolts from the Onshape library.

### Evidence

### Image

<img src="Images/FinalCasterAssembly.png" alt="" height="150">

### Reflection

One hiccup I had while doing this assingment was that after it was fully assembled, I accidentally deleted a part, but I clicked "Manage versions and history" and went back to before it was deleted, and reverted to that version. Also I learned that to access standard nuts and bolts you can go to "Insert" then "Standard Content".

## Onshape Fundamentals: Assemblies

### Description

In this assignment I did the Onshape learning pathway on assemblies up to the first exercise. It includes each mate type, what type of movement they constrain, and an exercise in which you assemble the pump of a soap bottle.

### Evidence

[Assembly Exercise in Onshape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/7c97ee6d0e6d1b0604c9c87b/w/86819eb89e2e7cca162b0530/e/8c25c6499758e71b28fe3cb5)

### Image

<img src="Images/AssemblyExercise.png" alt="" height="150">

### Reflection

So far I like how Onshape handles mates, it allows you to use one mate to constrain a peice to exactly the type of motion you want. For example fastened mates contrain all movement, revolute allows for rotation, slider allows it to move across one axis, planar allows movement on two axes, cylindrical allows one axis and rotation, and so on.

## Dorothy's Dowel Pins

### Description

In this assignment I designeda dowel pin and used configurations to make 16 versions, then made a frame connected by these pins, and assembled it.

### Evidence

### Reflection

I really like how configurations work in Onshape. In Solidworks configurations felt clunky, like using an external tool, but in Onshape they feel much more integrated into the normal UI and design process. Also, I don't know if this is possible in Solidworks, but in the assembly it allowed me to copy and paste many parts while remembering the mates between them.
