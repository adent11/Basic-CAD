## Base

### Description

In this assignment I created the base to the caster. It is a rectangular prism that is 200 mm x 120 mm x 8 mm with 6 10 mm holes equally spaced 20 mm from the edge.

### Reflection

This assignment wasn't particularly challenging as the basics of Onshape aren't very different than Solidworks. One useful thing that I learned was some of the shortcuts:
* Shift + S to sketch
* C for circle
* Shift E to extrude

## Mount

### Description

In this assignment I created the mount part of the caster. It is a 120 mm square extruded 8 mm with a 25 mm hole in the center and four 10 mm holes whose centers are 20 mm away from the edge. 

### Evidence

### Reflection

This assignment also wasn't a challenge, but one thing I learned in the tutorial video was how make multiple parts in the same part studio by selecting "New" instead of "Add" when you extrude.

## Fork

### Description

In this assignment I designed the fork that attaches the axle to the base of the caster. It has a circular base with two prongs, with holes for the axle, and a cylinder on the top that attaches to the base.

### Reflection

One thing that I learned is that you can select tangent propogation when doing a fillet to automatically select all edges tangent to the one you select; also the shortcut for a fillet is Shift + F.

## Tire

### Description

In this assignment I designed the tire of the caster. It is a trapezoid revolved around the origin to make the wheel, with fillets on both sides to round the edges.

### Reflection

Something useful that I learned is that if you place a dimension between a centerline and another line past the centerline, it doubles, making it convenient for making diameter.

## Wheel

### Description

In this assignment I designed the wheel of the caster. It is revolved I shape with holes cut to make spokes, then some fillets.

### Reflection

One thing that I learned in this assignment is that when you are doing a fillet or chamfer you can click a face and all of its edges will be selected.
