## Base

### Description

In this assignment I created the base to the caster. It is a rectangular prism that is 200 mm x 120 mm x 8 mm with 6 10 mm holes equally spaced 20 mm from the edge.

### Reflection

This assignment wasn't particularly challenging as the basics of Onshape aren't very different than Solidworks. One useful thing that I learned was some of the shortcuts:
* Shift + S to sketch
* C for circle
* Shift E to extrude
